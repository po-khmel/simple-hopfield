Simple Hopfield Network to retrieve image patterns

My goal was to generate a set of several images, which basically represent arrays, induce some changes in a randomly chosen image and 
try to retrieve initial image using Hopfield model.

I've used 2 approaches to generate patterns, but the code deals better with more randomly created ones.
